## 4.📝 Notes
1. Always use the latest firmware before flashing custom ROMs.
2. Follow the exact steps to avoid boot loops or bricked devices.
3. Utilize **ADB** and **Fastboot** tools for a seamless flashing experience.
4. A custom recovery and Magisk must be flashed after each update, as they are overwritten by the updating process.
5. Updates will be released monthly or quarterly, and unpopular ROMs with fewer than 10 users may be dropped eventually.
6. We welcome your opinions or corrections if they can help improve our work.
