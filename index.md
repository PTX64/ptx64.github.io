## 3. 🚀 First-Time Flashing Instructions for Xiaomi Redmi Note 10 (Sunny/Mojito)

**⚠ Disclaimer:** Flashing a custom ROM carries risks, including data loss, boot loops, or bricked devices. Follow these instructions carefully. By proceeding, you acknowledge that any issues arising from improper flashing are your responsibility.

---

## 📌 Preparation Steps

### 1. Backup Your Data
Before proceeding, create a complete backup of your device. Flashing for the first time will erase all data and restore factory defaults.

### 2. Download and Flash Stock Firmware
- Download the latest firmware ([V14.0.9.0.SKGMIXM](https://mifirm.net/download/12791)).
- Extract the downloaded firmware package.

### 3. Enter Fastboot Mode
1. Power off your device.
2. Hold **Volume Down + Power** simultaneously to enter Fastboot mode.

### 4. Connect and Flash Stock Firmware
1. Connect your device to a PC via USB-C.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the extracted firmware folder and run:
   - **Windows:** `flash_all.bat`
   - **Linux/macOS:** `flash_all.sh`

### 5. Verify and Boot
- Ensure the flashing process completes with a "Success" message.
- If it fails, repeat Step 4 or force reboot by holding the Power button.
- Wait for the **MIUI** setup screen to appear after a successful flash.
- **Complete the MIUI setup** until the home screen is fully loaded, thereby finishing the MIUI post-installation process.

## 🔧 Flashing a custom ROM for the first time

### 6. Flash Custom ROM
1. Download your desired ROM, its 'boot.img' and 'vendor_boot.img' files
2. Re-enter Fastboot mode (see Step 3).
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Flash the recovery image using:
   - `fastboot flash boot boot.img`
   - `fastboot flash vendor_boot vendor_boot.img`
   - `fastboot reboot recovery`
5. In recovery mode:
   - Navigate using **Volume buttons** and confirm with the **Power** button.
   - Select **Apply Update > Apply from ADB**.
6. Flash the ROM:
   - `adb sideload your_rom.zip`
7. Once flashing is complete, restart recovery when prompted.

### 7. Factory Reset, Boot and Updating ROM
1. **Perform a factory reset in the custom recovery:**
   - Navigate to **Factory Reset** and confirm the action twice.
2. **Reboot your device** to load the new ROM.
3. **Flashing or updating a ROM** can now be done using the Updater app, or by rebooting the device into recovery mode and flashing a new ZIP image.

## 🔓 Optional: Root Access & Custom Recovery

### 8. Install Magisk (Root) and/or Custom Recovery
1. Download **Magisk** from [GitHub](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk) and/or the **TWRP (Team Win Recovery Project)**, **PBRP (Pitch Black Recovery Project)**, or  **OrangeFox Recovery** custom recovery from [this location](https://github.com/PTX64/releases_sunny_recoveries/releases/tag/latest).
2. **Disable your screen lock or set it to "swipe."** Otherwise, the custom recovery may be unable to decrypt your data partition.
3. Boot into recovery mode and install the custom recovery first (if required):
   - `adb sideload your_custom_recovery.zip`
4. Flash Magisk:
   - `adb sideload Magisk-version.apk`
   -  In TWRP and PBRP recovery, navigate to the /Magisk/Magisk.zip file and proceed to flash the zip. Additionally, OrangeFox features the latest Magisk support integrated directly into its user interface.

## ⚠️ Common Issues & Fixes

### 1. Black Screen After Booting Custom Recovery
- **Cause:** The ROM uses `vendor_boot`, which can cause issues with custom recoveries.
- **Solution:** 
  1. Use a ROM that supports non-`vendor_boot` recoveries.
  2. Ensure you flash both the `boot` and `vendor_boot` images correctly.

### 2. Screen Hangs in Custom Recovery
- **Cause:** The recovery may not support encryption, or the data partition may be corrupted.

#### Action 1: Disable Screen Lock
- **Solution:** Disable your screen lock for better compatibility.

#### Action 2: Perform Factory Reset or Use a Compatible Recovery
- **Solution:** If the issue persists, perform a factory reset or switch to a recovery that supports decryption.

### 3. Touchscreen/Sideloading Not Working in Recovery
- **Cause:** An outdated ROM or firmware may have loaded old vendor firmware.
- **Solution:** Flash the latest ROM to update the vendor partition.

✅ **You're all set!** Enjoy your new custom ROM!

## 4.📝 Notes
1. Always use the latest firmware before flashing custom ROMs.
2. Follow the exact steps to avoid boot loops or bricked devices.
