## ⚠️ Common Issues & Fixes

### 1. Black Screen After Booting Custom Recovery
- **Cause:** The ROM uses `vendor_boot`, which can cause issues with custom recoveries.
- **Solution:** 
  1. Use a ROM that supports non-`vendor_boot` recoveries.
  2. Ensure you flash both the `boot` and `vendor_boot` images correctly.

### 2. Screen Hangs in Custom Recovery
- **Cause:** The recovery may not support encryption, or the data partition may be corrupted.

#### Action 1: Disable Screen Lock
- **Solution:** Disable your screen lock for better compatibility.

#### Action 2: Perform Factory Reset or Use a Compatible Recovery
- **Solution:** If the issue persists, perform a factory reset or switch to a recovery that supports decryption.

### 3. Touchscreen/Sideloading Not Working in Recovery
- **Cause:** An outdated ROM or firmware may have loaded old vendor firmware.
- **Solution:** Flash the latest ROM to update the vendor partition.
